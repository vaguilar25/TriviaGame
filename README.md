# Trivia Game
Create trivia form with multiple choices .

The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 

The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.


The player can't pick more than one answer per question.

I also show a countdown timer.
